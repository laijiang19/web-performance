# Instructions

1. Go to this jsPerf and read the 3 Task instructions: http://jsperf.com/advanced-js-workshop-webperf-example/edit 

2. Going to that exact URL will allow you to fork your test off the **FIRST** revision of that test (so that each attendee has their own revision). Fill in your info in the blank form. Make sure while you play around with your test, you **UNCHECK** the checkbox about not publishing your test yet.

3. Read each task carefully. Make sure to create "fair" tests (that is, tests which are minimal, and are only testing in each case the same "amount" of code, so as to be apples-to-apples, as much as possible).

4. After you complete each task, record the results somewhere (like in a text file here) because each edit will wipe out the results.

5. Looking back over the results, are there things which surprised you? Why do think different browsers sometimes have very different results on these sorts of tests?

6. Did you find it hard to create a "fair" test? What do you think happens to the results when you do more "work" in the test cases than is necessary? If you do extra operations in the test cases, but do the same amount, do you still expect a sane outcome? Why or why not?
